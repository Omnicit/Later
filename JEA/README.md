# JEA
This is just an example of how the JEA endpoint was created.

### Files
- [New-PSRoleCapabilityFile.ps1](New-PSRoleCapabilityFile.ps1) - Create the role capability file (included in source when building).
- [New-PSSessionConfigurationFile.ps1](New-PSSessionConfigurationFile.ps1) - Create the Session Configuration file and the JEA endpoint.

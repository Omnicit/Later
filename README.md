# Local Admin Temporary Elevation Request
This is [my](http://twitter.com/KPHaglund) realization of Local Administrator Temporary Elevation Request (LATER) concept Mathias R. Jessen ([@IISResetMe](https://twitter.com/IISResetMe)) talked about in the session "Attack Surface Reductions - for the Adventurous Admin" at PowerShell Conference Europe 2019.
If you couldn't attend the session in person the great people of #PSConfEU have uploaded the recording on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/KVYtPpxj_S0).

## Usage
I've [written a blogpost]() on how the concept became realized.
